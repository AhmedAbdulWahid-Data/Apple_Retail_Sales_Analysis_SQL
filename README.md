    FROM ProductSales
) t
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

### 12. Calculate how many warranty claims were filed within 180 days of a product sale.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS claims_within_180_days
FROM warranty_claims wc

```

### 14. List the months in the last three years where sales exceeded 5,000 units in the USA.
```sql
SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS year, MONTH(sale_date) AS month, SUM(units_sold) AS total_units
FROM sales
JOIN stores ON sales.store_id = stores.store_id
WHERE country = 'USA' AND sale_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 YEAR)
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
HAVING total_units > 5000;
```

### 15. Identify the product category with the most warranty claims filed in the last two years.
```sql
SELECT p.category, COUNT(*) AS total_claims
FROM warranty_claims wc
JOIN products p ON wc.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE wc.claim_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR)
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_claims DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## üî¥ Complex Questions (5 Questions)

### 16. Determine the percentage chance of receiving warranty claims after each purchase for each country.

FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN warranty_claims wc ON s.product_id = wc.product_id
JOIN stores st ON s.store_id = st.store_id
GROUP BY country;
```

### 17. Analyze the year-by-year growth ratio for each store.
```sql
WITH YearlySales AS (
    SELECT store_id, YEAR(sale_date) AS year, SUM(units_sold) AS total_units_sold
    FROM sales

FROM (
    SELECT p.product_id, p.price, 
           COUNT(wc.claim_id) AS claim_count,
           CASE 
               WHEN p.price < 100 THEN 'Low'
               WHEN p.price BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'Medium'
               ELSE 'High'
           END AS price_range
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN warranty_claims wc ON p.product_id = wc.product_id

```sql
SELECT store_id, 
       (COUNT(CASE WHEN claim_status = 'Paid Repaired' THEN 1 END) * 100.0
       / COUNT(*)) AS repair_percentage
FROM warranty_claims
GROUP BY store_id
ORDER BY repair_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 20. Write a query to calculate the monthly running total of sales for each store over the past four years and compare trends during this period.
```sql
SELECT store_id, YEAR(sale_date) AS year, MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
       SUM(units_sold) OVER (PARTITION BY store_id ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date),
       MONTH(sale_date)) AS running_total
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 4 YEAR);
```

## Bonus Question

### Analyze product sales trends over time, segmented into key periods: from launch to 6 months, 6-12 months, 12-18 months, and beyond 18 months.
```sql
WITH SalesPeriod AS (
    SELECT product_id, product_name, launch_date, sale_date, units_sold,
           CASE 
               WHEN sale_date <= DATE_ADD(launch_date, INTERVAL 6 MONTH) THEN '0-6 Months'
               WHEN sale_date <= DATE_ADD(launch_date, INTERVAL 12 MONTH) THEN '6-12 Months'
               WHEN sale_date <= DATE_ADD(launch_date, INTERVAL 18 MONTH) THEN '12-18 Months'
               ELSE 'Beyond 18 Months'
           END AS sales_period
    FROM sales
)
SELECT sales_period, SUM(units_sold) AS total_units_sold
FROM SalesPeriod
GROUP BY sales_period;
```
